Check the version 
I got v18.15.0

2.	Create a backend folder to start the setup

Create a new Backend folder, mkdir Backend and go to the Backend folder and setup the package.json file

The easiest way is to do the npm init and answer a few questions

After that install a few dependencies 

npm install express cors mongodb dotenv

Express is a framework that acts as a light layer for the Node.js

Package name has to be in lower case
