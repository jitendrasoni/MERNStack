# React.js Introduction
Node.js will be the express backend is basically first letter of MERN Stack development project.

# Node.js Setup (ATLAS CLOUD DATABASE)

1.	Best way to start is to create a new react-app, run below command and create the frontend folder in parallel to the backend folder.

`npx create-react-app frontend`

the name should be the lower case, otherwise you will get an error

At this stage, I again realised that I should have kept all folder names in the lower case, because if you are working on the FE application with BE, it's a bit weired to keep different different type of the navming conventions, so in case the FE has the hard restriction to keep the name in the lower case, so I would prefer to keep everthing in lower case for the projecct structure.

Default output once you have installed the react app

//`Run `npm audit` for details.

Success! Created frontend at C:\projects\personal\MERNStack\frontend
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd frontend
  npm start

Happy hacking!

2. Defautl react folder structure after creating the first app

//imaga

It has a node_modules, public folder, src folder
go into the front end folder and do npm start

Here is the first react app running on port 3000
